A powerful and intuitive web application for Japanese language learners. Upload your **EPUBs** or **subtitle files**, and let the app:

* **Analyze word frequency** across the entire content.
* **Display definitions** using a lightweight, custom-tailored version of **JMdict**.
* Help you **learn the most frequent words** in the media you provided using a built-in **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**.

Built with **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Node.js** for speed, scalability, and responsiveness.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express
* **Storage**: MongoDB
* **Dictionary**: Custom-minified version of [JMdict](https://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/j_jmdict.html)

## Why This Project?

Reading native Japanese content is one of the best ways to improve, but:

* It's hard to know which words are important.
* Existing tools are too heavy or not beginner-friendly.
* You lose track of what youâ€™ve seen and learned.

This app solves that by giving you a **focused, frequency-based learning path**, all built into the reading experience itself.
